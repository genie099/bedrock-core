## Auto-generating API Documentation

Good API documentation needs love, so make sure to take the time to describe parameters, create examples, etc.

There's a script that automatically generates an OpenAPI definition for any added routes.

Run:

```
node scripts/generate-openapi.js
```

The information in `src/v1/__openapi__` is exposed through the API and used by the Markdown-powered documentation portal in `/services/web/src/docs`.
